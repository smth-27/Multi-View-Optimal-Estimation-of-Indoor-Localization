# Multi-View-Optimal-Estimation-of-Indoor-Localization

This project presents a sophisticated Hidden Markov Chain Model (HMCM) tailored for precise indoor
localization, addressing the limitations of conventional GPS signals in challenging environments.
Through meticulous preprocessing and feature extraction, the HMCM leverages PCA to transform data
and employs Random Forest classifiers and regressors for building classification, outdoor detection, and
geospatial coordinate prediction. Experimental validation demonstrates superior performance compared
to traditional methods, with high accuracy in building classification and precise location estimation.
Confusion matrices and RMSE values provide quantitative insights into the model's effectiveness,
highlighting its potential for navigation systems, asset tracking, and emergency response scenarios. The
HMCM represents a versatile and potent solution for indoor localization challenges, offering
remarkable accuracy and paving the way for enhanced location-based services across diverse domains.

The multi-view optimal estimation of indoor localization via deep probabilistic generalization learning
model introduces a novel and effective solution to indoor localization challenges. By integrating deep
learning and probabilistic modeling, the model captures intricate signal patterns and dependencies while
providing uncertainty estimates. Experimental results showcase its superior performance in localization
accuracy and uncertainty estimation. The model's capability to generate realistic location estimates and
quantify uncertainties promises more robust indoor localization systems applicable in navigation, asset
tracking, and emergency response domains.
